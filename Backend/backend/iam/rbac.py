"""Which roles a person may hold, given what they are.

Fusion's authorization has always been a flat list of designation strings. That
list answers "what is this person allowed to do" but never "was this person
allowed to be given that in the first place", and the two are different
questions. `globals_holdsdesignation` is a plain join table: it will happily
record a student as Dean Academic, and in the live data it does.

The model here:

  * A **basic role** — student, faculty or staff — comes from the ERP's
    `user_type`. Exactly one, never assigned, never changed by this console.
  * **Additional roles** are the designations, held on top and held in any
    number. A faculty member is an Associate Professor *and* a HOD *and* the
    Dean Academic at the same time.
  * A role declares which basic roles may hold it. An academic rank belongs to
    faculty; an office belongs to faculty or staff; a functional role — convenor,
    coordinator, warden, committee member — is open to anyone, which is how a
    student becomes a club coordinator.

Uncatalogued roles are allowed and reported rather than refused. The ERP's
academic office adds designations without telling this service, and a role
appearing overnight must not lock its holder out; it must show up on a list
somebody reads.
